## This API is deprecated for a long time because of the website's restriction. Sorry about that, but there's almost no way to fix it.<br>This API is now archived.

# "Touwa" API
Welcome to the GitHub page of a REST API called Touwa!

## What is "Touwa"?
"Touwa" is an **unofficial** REST API that gets information from a Vietnamese R-18 website called [HentaiVN.tv](https://hentaivn.tv). This API can get some important information from the website without any authorization or anything.

This API is currently in development and incomplete, but I will add more functions if I have time.

## Documentations
The API documentation will be coming soon at [the Wiki page of this repository](https://github.com/LilShieru/Touwa/wiki).

## Demo
You can try the demo version of this API in the Glitch host website:
